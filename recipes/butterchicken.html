    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using your Instant Pot is an easy way to make a chicken and rice casserole. Once you get the ingredients prepped and into the pot, it’s mostly hands-off from there. While the Instant Pot cooks, you’ll be free to do whatever else you need to do… make a salad, fold a load of laundry, 
        or just sit on the couch with your feet up!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil: The olive oil is used for sautéing the vegetables.</li>
        <li>
        Onion & Garlic: These provide a base layer of flavor to the dish.
        Carrots: Carrots are the perfect vegetable to cook in the Instant Pot because they will soften without breaking down.</li>
        <li>
        Brown Rice: Be sure to use long grain brown rice in this recipe. White rice cooks much faster in the Instant Pot and could burn with the cook time used in this recipe.</li>
        <li>
        Dijon Mustard: Dijon enhances the flavor, but it does not make the finished dish taste like mustard.</li>
        <li>
        Seasonings: Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper are used to season the chicken and rice.</li>
        <li>
        Chicken Broth: The broth is the liquid that allows the Instant Pot to reach pressure, and it also absorbs into the rice as it cooks. I recommend using low sodium chicken broth so that you can control the amount of salt in the finished dish.</li>
        <li>
        Chicken Breasts: Boneless, skinless chicken breasts provide lean protein. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs can be substituted, with no change in the recipe cook time.</li>
        <li>
        Frozen Peas: To add more veggies and a pop of color.</li>
        <li>
        Parmesan Cheese: This dish is extra delicious served with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the onion and carrots in the Instant Pot using the sauté function. Then turn the Instant Pot off.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the brown rice, Dijon, seasonings and chicken broth. Stir well and scrape up any bits of food that are stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken breasts on top of the rice mixture</li>
            <li>Close the lid and set the valve to the sealing position.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook on high pressure for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the pot naturally release for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Quick release any remaining pressure by carefully moving the valve to the venting position.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken to a clean cutting board.</li>
            <li>Stir the peas into the Instant Pot. Put the lid back on the pot and let it rest for 5 minutes to heat the peas through.</li>
            <li>Chop the chicken into bite-size pieces and stir it back into the Instant Pot.</li>
            </ol>
