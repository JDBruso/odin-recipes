<h2>Hi Meghan!</h2>
<div class="a"><p>I just wrapped up this recipe book, which is the first project in The Odin Project course. Mainly meant to get people familiar with the HTML template, lists, links, images, and pushing changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
     After making three of these I think I got the hang of it, but as you can see its still very basic! Going forward I'll dress these up a bit. I couldn't help myself and had to make SOMEthing for you.
     </p>
    
    
   <h2> My Best Friend (and future wife)</h2>
<p>Best friend, girlfriend, neither of those do you justice. So I'm just gonna have to marry your ass. When we matched, I never in my life thought we'd be where we are today. 
    You're so much more than just a lover. Don't get me wrong, that stuffs important and we are <strong>more</strong> than compatible. 
    But you're what I've always wanted in a friend too.</p>
    
    <p>You supported me when I was low, and you accept me for who I am. Even when I get concerned about things that aren't really a concern. For example, I feel like we don't text as much anymore.
        I liked our long winded messages and voice mails! But we talk on the phone for hours now, and honestly we still do text, but your voice messages are my favorite. And we talk on the phone for hours in the morning and at night, so I know my concerns are just me missing you. Everytime you say you wish I could see myself the way you see me, it reminds me that
        you really believe in me, and when I remember that, its so invigorating it feels like I can conquer anything. 
        You (and your family) are so generous and giving. You made me a fucking playlist for crying out loud! The way you actually listen and pay attention and care
        about what I say or what we're watching makes every experience I have with you so god damn special because you're really present.
        </p>

        <p>When I'm with you, I'm happy and content in a way I can't describe. And looking at you drives me insane, because to me you are the most beautiful person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. I'm not worried about court, or probation, or my family, or the cliquei-ness that AA has. I'm not worried about finances, debt, or anything else. 
            When I'm not with you, I want to talk to you, and when I talk to you it elevates me and sticks with me for hours. When we're not talking and we're apart, you're just always at the forefront of my mind. The minute my phone rings,
            or you pick up the phone, and especially when you show up, it doesn't matter if there was worry or anger or depression or frustration or whatever negativity was plaguing my mind at the time. It just clears up and fucks off as soon as I hear your voice or hold you again.

        </p>

    <p>I've told you all of this stuff before, I know.  
        
        All I'm trying to say is that you hold a special place in my heart and in my life. I've learned so much from you, and continue to do so every day. You're what's first in the morning and always the last thing before I go to sleep. 
        It is always a victory when I do something to make you smile, and if I make you laugh I'm so happy that I could bring joy to someone I love. Our relationship is something I respect and cherish dearly. I hope you don't think this was too cheesy,
        because I plan on marrying your ass and there's a whole lot more cheese where this came from. We're two dreamers in love with eachother and the future, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I love you.
