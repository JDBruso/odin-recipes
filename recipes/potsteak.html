    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Instant Pot steak is incredibly juicy, tender and flavorful! Using a pressure cooker to cook steak is easy, quick and straightforward. This pressure cooker steak 
        recipe yields the most irresistibly delicious steak!</p>
    <p>Any cut of steak will work. Both ribeyes and sirloins are great options since they are tender and flavorful to begin with. I recommend using steak that is about 1 inch thick and boneless. Add more time for bone in.

        <p>The homemade steak seasoning adds the perfect amount of flavor. The seasonings are flavorful enough to complement the steaks without being overwhelming. Feel free to add, subtract and adjust seasonings to suit your taste. Or, substitute with 2 tablespoons Montreal steak seasoning if desired.
        
        Olive oil creates a great sear on the steaks. Substitute with butter, avocado oil, or vegetable oil if needed.</p>
